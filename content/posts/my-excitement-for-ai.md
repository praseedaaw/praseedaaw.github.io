My Excitement for AI-Augmented Testing

<!--more-->

Being in software testing and QA automation engineering for about one and a half decades, I’ve had the privilege of witnessing how technology evolves year by year — and how that evolution shapes our expectations for user experience. As products aim for better UX, testing too has transformed dramatically. Today, we are not just software engineers; we are living in an AI-powered era. What once seemed like futuristic imagination — bots helping us with our tasks — is now at our fingertips, incredibly easy to use.

I want to start sharing some stories of how AI has helped me — not in jargon, but in simple words. I live in Netherlands, but come from **Kerala**, a place where people are close to nature and value simplicity. That’s why I want my blog to be **authentic**, written in **layman’s language**. Because to me, technology today is becoming more like a story — one that we all can understand and be part of.

For QA engineers like me, life is becoming significantly easier with the introduction of **AI-augmented testing**. Even after many years in the field, I still feel a child-like excitement when I hear about new tools or breakthroughs. I want to learn them. I want to experience them. That curiosity never fades. Of course, stepping into a new domain comes with a hint of fear — fear of not knowing enough, fear of being compared to those who know more, fear of failure. But those fears are part of being human. They come because we can think, reflect, and evolve.

I reminded myself that the people who created AI are also human beings — people who were once curious, excited, and dedicated their time to building something valuable. If they could build this technology, then why should I be afraid of using it to enhance my work? That mindset was the beginning of my journey into learning **AI for testing**. And to my surprise, it turned out to be much simpler than I had initially imagined.

Let me take you back two years. In 2023, I used to spend a significant amount of time writing test cases. Like any QA engineer, I was constantly juggling between manual testing efforts and maintaining test automation. You might be going through the same challenge — or maybe you’ve already crossed that bridge using AI.

As a beginner in AI, I started exploring tools and decided to use **GitHub Copilot** to help design test cases in **BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) using Gherkin format**. That was a **game changer**. Here’s how it worked for me:

I imagined Copilot as a **colleague** who had returned after a long vacation. I described the new feature we were working on and asked her if she could help me write some Gherkin test scenarios — because she was always an expert at that. I wasn’t sure how much she could help, but within **seconds**, she responded with well-structured scenarios. We iterated together, reviewed, refined, and in just a few minutes, I had the best version of test cases ready.

It was like **pair programming**, except one of us was an AI assistant.

That was just the beginning. My journey with AI-augmented testing continues, and with each step, I feel more empowered, more efficient, and more excited. If you’re a QA engineer curious about AI — don’t let fear hold you back. Be curious. Be playful. Ask questions. Try things. Because the future of testing isn’t about replacing us; it’s about **augmenting us** — making us better at what we love to do.

Stay tuned for more stories on how AI is transforming testing! Let me simplify it for you!
