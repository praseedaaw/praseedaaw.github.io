# *Children's Day Face Painting Experience*

In India, Children's Day is celebrated on **14 November** every year to honour the birth anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who believed deeply in nurturing children's happiness and creativity. Although we are far from home, today — **15 November** — we celebrated it here in the Netherlands with a lovely event organised by **Bridging The Gap Foundation** in **Nieuw-Vennep**.

As a weekend hobby, I volunteered — completely free — as a **face painter**, blending my love for art with community service. For the first time, my canvases didn't stay still… they were sweet, excited, giggling little faces full of innocence. I painted around **30 children's faces**, and every tiny smile felt like a reward. When the children were happy, I felt confident that the quality of my work was good.

## The Magic of Moving Canvases

It was magical watching different characters come alive on their foreheads — **Stitch, unicorns, butterflies, sharks, Spider-Man, Minecraft icons, Pokémon, lions**, and many more.

Each child came with their own vision, their own favorite character, and their own excitement. Some were specific about colors, others trusted me completely with the design. The variety was incredible — from delicate butterflies that required gentle strokes to bold superhero masks that needed strong, confident lines.

## A Moment of Pure Trust

One moment I'll never forget: a small girl fell asleep while I was painting her. That pure trust is something I've never experienced while working on regular canvases.

In that quiet moment, as she peacefully dozed while I carefully painted around her closed eyes, I realized how different this art form is from my usual Kerala mural paintings or watercolor works. This wasn't just about creating something beautiful — it was about creating joy, building trust, and being part of someone's special day.

## Six Hours of Pure Joy

I painted for six hours straight, yet the joy of the day made every moment meaningful. And the most heartwarming part — my daughter joined me as my "assistant artist," happily creating hand tattoos for the children.


Watching her carefully draw small designs on tiny hands, seeing her interact with the children, and observing how naturally she took to this form of community service filled my heart. She was learning not just about art, but about giving back, about making others happy, and about the joy that comes from volunteering.

## The Reward of Smiles

When I paint on canvas, I create something that might hang on a wall or be admired by a few. But when I painted these children's faces, I created immediate joy. The instant transformation — from a regular child to their favorite character — brought such genuine happiness that it was impossible not to smile along with them.

Every "Wow!" and "I look so cool!" was worth more than any art exhibition review. These weren't critics analyzing brush techniques or color combinations — these were pure, honest reactions to art that made them feel special.

## Art as Community Service

This experience reinforced something I've always believed: art has the power to connect, to heal, and to bring joy. Whether it's through my Kerala mural paintings that preserve cultural heritage, or this face painting volunteering, art becomes a bridge between people.

Volunteering my artistic skills felt natural — it was a way to give back to the community that has welcomed us here in the Netherlands, while also celebrating the cultural values we carry from India about nurturing children's happiness.

## Reflection

A truly beautiful Saturday, filled with colour, innocence, and joy.

As I cleaned my brushes at the end of the day, I realized that this experience had given me more than I had given to the children. It reminded me why I fell in love with art in the first place — not for perfection or recognition, but for the simple joy of creating something that makes others happy.

The Children's Day celebration may have been thousands of miles from India, but the spirit of Pandit Nehru's vision — nurturing children's creativity and happiness — was very much alive in that community center in Nieuw-Vennep.
