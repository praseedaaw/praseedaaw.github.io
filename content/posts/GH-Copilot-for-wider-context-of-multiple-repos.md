GitHub Copilot Web’s Superpower: Wider context for Holistic Quality of microservices

<!--more-->

# GitHub Copilot’s Superpower: Understanding Microservices in Context — A New Era for Holistic Quality

In modern, event-driven architectures, **microservices** communicate through streams, messages, and shared contracts. Tools like **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Pulsar**, **RabbitMQ**, and **NATS** are foundational to this pattern. But with that comes complexity — and a major challenge:

> **How do you understand the impact of a change when your system is spread across 10, 20, or even 50 microservices?**

Traditionally, this has been a pain point — not only for QA Automation Engineers but also for Product Engineers and Architects. Gaining visibility into cross-service dependencies often meant hours of manual tracing and unclear communication paths.

When working in a microservices ecosystem:
- A simple feature change may trigger multiple downstream events
- It's hard to foresee the **ripple effects** during the Discovery phase
- Integration-level visibility is often missing or buried in documentation

This gap makes **end-to-end (E2E) validation** of event flows difficult — and risks go unnoticed until later stages.

That’s where **GitHub Copilot Web in Agent Mode** brings in a game-changing ability:  
**Widening the context** to **analyze and reason across many repositories at once**.

This isn’t just about code suggestions — it’s about enabling **holistic quality thinking** across a distributed system, starting as early as the **Discovery phase**.

## Why GitHub Copilot Web (Agent Mode) Is a Game Changer


One of the most powerful and underrated features of **GitHub Copilot Web in Agent Mode** is its ability to handle **wider context** — across **multiple repositories at once**.

In large-scale systems where services are distributed and interdependent, understanding the full picture often requires:
- Jumping between codebases
- Manually tracing event definitions and handlers
- Syncing with multiple teams

Copilot Web Agent removes that friction. It can:
- Read through many repositories simultaneously  
- Understand shared event contracts and communication patterns  
- Generate contextual outputs like diagrams, summaries, or even visual workflows

This unlocks entirely new ways to support **impact analysis, architecture visualization, and automated documentation** — especially during the **Discovery phase** of development.

## Use Case: AI-Generated Event Flow Diagrams Between Microservices

In a recent experiment, I used Copilot Web (Agent Mode) to help visualize how events flowed between several microservices.

### Objective:  
Generate a **Mermaid diagram** that maps out all events exchanged among microservices in the system.

### My Prompt:

> **"Select the attached services under <Parent repo> as the context. As a QA engineer, I want to create an impact chart of any change introducing to any service, and event messaging between micro-services. As an expert solution architect, can you create a mermaid syntax of all the events happening between micro-services? Mention the exact names of events in the connection lines/arrows, and provide steps to create a graphical dependency diagram. Also, create a Miro board using the Mermaid diagram."**

### What Copilot Did:
- Parsed multiple services in the provided repo group
- Identified the relevant event publishers and consumers
- Generated a valid **Mermaid syntax** graph
- Provided clear steps to **render the diagram visually** using **Miro** or similar tools

This drastically improved visibility for both Product and QA teams — before any implementation began.

## Why This Matters

- Product teams can **foresee side effects** before development begins  
- Engineers gain **confidence in their change impact**  
- QA teams can **test smarter**, not harder  
- Discovery becomes **collaborative and data-driven**

---

## So,

What used to be a black box between microservices can now be **mapped and understood** — with the help of AI.

This makes Discovery more powerful, actionable, and collaborative than ever before.

The **life of engineers is becoming easier**, and smarter.  
Let’s start designing systems with visibility, right from the start.
