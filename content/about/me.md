Hello and welcome! 👋  

I’m a **QA Automation Engineer** by profession, an **artist** by passion, and someone who truly enjoys **building connections and organizing meaningful experiences**. My journey has always revolved around **quality** — whether it’s ensuring high standards in software, creating art that speaks from the heart, or fostering collaboration through community events.

## Quality Engineering & Automation  
My professional story began in software testing, where I discovered how much I enjoy making systems reliable and efficient. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively in **QA Automation**, exploring frameworks and tools that help teams shift from repetitive validation to **smart, maintainable testing**.  

I’m fascinated by how **AI-augmented testing**, **autonomous test bots**, and **vibe testing tools** are shaping the future of quality. What excites me most is not just testing for defects but **building confidence in products** — ensuring that every release brings value to users and peace of mind to teams.

## The Artist Within  
Outside the world of automation scripts and CI pipelines, I find balance through **art** — particularly **Kerala mural painting**. This traditional form of art from my homeland is meditative, detailed, and deeply rooted in storytelling.  

I also craft paintings based on watercolors. Also organise workshops for children in clay arts/sculpture making.

## Organizing & Volunteering  
Beyond work and art, I find purpose in **bringing people together**. Whether it’s organizing QA meetups, volunteering at community events, or coordinating cultural gatherings, I love creating spaces where people can share, learn, and grow.  

For me, volunteering is a way to give back, stay grounded, and keep learning from others’ stories. I believe the best communities are built on **collaboration, empathy, and shared curiosity** — the same values that guide my work as a tester and as a person.

## Why I Do What I Do  
In everything I pursue — **engineering, art, or community** — my goal is simple:  
To bring **clarity, creativity, and connection** into whatever I create or contribute to.  

Quality isn’t just about software to me. It’s about doing things with care, intent, and a touch of art.
