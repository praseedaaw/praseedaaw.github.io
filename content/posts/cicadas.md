Cicadas in my motherland - Kerala

<!--more-->

Silence is relative to each land.  
In my homeland, Kerala,  
It is the sound of Cicadas,  
That always plays in the background.  

I have never seen them,  
But I know they are around me,  
On the green, leafy trees of  
This tropical land - Kerala.  

Vehicles have to horn loud here,  
To outperform Cicadasâ€™ song.  
Even the engines are designed  
To produce sounds louder.  

What would they be singing about,  
Day and night, without a break?  
Are they reciting a poem about  
Insect world and their dreams?  

How many of them will be living around my house?  
I suppose at least a hundred.  
Thank you, Cicadas, for the white noise  
To calm down my busiest mind.
