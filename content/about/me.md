Hello, I’m Praseeda, a QA Automation Engineering professional with a passion for technology, arts, and community engagement. Originally from Kerala, India, I moved to the Netherlands in 2015 and have been shaping my career in QA and Automation Engineering since 2010.

Currently, I work as a Senior QA Automation Engineer in the Platform Quality team at Catawiki. Our focus is on building a centralized quality ecosystem that seamlessly integrates with development workflows. Beyond my core role, I love exploring different areas of the organization—co-organizing Tech Talks and serving as a Work Council member to support and connect with colleagues.

Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about volunteering for socio-cultural activities and expressing my creativity through painting and dancing. I live in the Netherlands with my husband and our beautiful daughter, cherishing both my roots and the diverse experiences this journey has offered me.

For me, technology, arts, and community are not separate aspects of life but interconnected passions that drive me every day.
