A story about my first Kerala Mural Painting

<!--more-->

I’m incredibly happy to share something close to my heart — my **first-ever Kerala mural painting**, titled *"Kathakali in Kerala Mural"*. It has a size of 34 cm * 45 cm and uses acrylic paints and Indian black ink. This project began in **September last year**, and I recently completed it under the expert guidance of my guru, **Sri. Manoj Mathasseril** ([About Manoj Sir](https://www.manojmathasseril.com/about)). What began as curiosity evolved into a deeply fulfilling artistic and cultural experience — one that connects me to my roots in Kerala in a profoundly meaningful way.

## A Cultural Calling: Why Kathakali?

When I first started learning Kerala mural painting, I was filled with excitement but also faced the classic beginner’s question: *What should my first subject be?* Surprisingly, the answer came easily.

**Kathakali** — Kerala’s majestic and expressive classical dance-drama — has always fascinated me. Rich in storytelling, color, and symbolism, it felt like the perfect muse to bring into my first mural painting. My visit to the **Kerala Kathakali Centre in Cochin** during a trip home last year deepened that inspiration. That visit was a turning point, bridging the emotion of witnessing Kathakali live with the urge to depict it through the timeless strokes of mural art.

When I shared this desire with **Manoj Sir**, he warmly encouraged it and guided me into the world of **Kerala mural painting**, blending tradition with passion in every lesson.

## The Process: More Than Just Painting

Learning Kerala mural painting is not just about technique. It’s a meditative journey — one that demands:
- **Patience**
- **Dedication**
- A true **eagerness to immerse in the process**

Though I live in the **Netherlands**, I was fortunate to continue my learning remotely with Manoj Sir. Across sessions, we worked steadily, step by step — understanding not just how to paint, but **why** each element matters in the mural tradition. Finishing the painting was a challenge — as most artists will tell you, it's easy to get caught up in the imperfections. In fact, the **80/20 rule** (also known as the Pareto Principle) applies so well here — 80% of the work often gets done quickly, but it's the final 20% that takes most of the time, energy, and emotional effort to get just right. But at some point, the work must be declared *complete* — and here it is.

## Presenting: *Kathakali in Kerala Mural*

This mural is more than just an art piece. It’s a **symbol of heritage**, a **tribute to Kathakali**, and a **token of gratitude** for my guru who opened this artistic path for me.

**Thank you, Manoj Sir**, for your wisdom, patience, and inspiration. This is just the beginning of a lifelong journey into mural art.

If you’re curious about Kerala mural painting or Kathakali, or are simply an art lover, I’d love to hear your thoughts and connect with you. There’s so much beauty in our traditions — and I’m grateful to be learning and sharing it, one brushstroke at a time.
