Hello, I’m Praseeda, a woman with passions for technology, arts, and community engagement. Originally from Kerala, India, I moved to the Netherlands in 2015 and have been shaping my career in QA and Automation Engineering since 2010.

By profession, I have been always into Quality Assurance and Automation Engineering sector of different Software companies of domains - E-commerce, Healthcare, Banking, Insurance, Entertainment and Legal since 2010. I love the way Quality Engineering is customised in different companies suitable for each of them, which reflects how Engineering is about solving problems. Beyond my core role, I love exploring different areas of the organization—co-organizing Tech Talks and serving as a Work Council member to support and connect with colleagues.

Outside of work, I am deeply passionate about volunteering for socio-cultural activities and expressing my creativity regularly through painting and occationally through dancing. I live in the Netherlands with my husband and our beautiful daughter, cherishing both my roots and the diverse experiences this journey has offered me.

For me, technology, arts, and community are not separate aspects of life but interconnected passions that drive me every day.
