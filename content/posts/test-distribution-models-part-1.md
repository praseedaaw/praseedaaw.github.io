Test Distribution – The need for Customization

# Test Distribution – The need for Customization

When we build and test an application, we know it must go through multiple **testing levels**:  
**Unit**, **Component Integration**, **End-to-End (E2E)**, and **Exploratory** testing.

But have you ever paused to ask:  
*Which levels should be dense in test coverage? And where can we be lighter?*

The answer, in my experience, **depends on the context** — the nature of the application.

---

## Understanding the Scope of Test Levels

Before diving into test distribution models, it's important to understand what each level is responsible for:

- **Unit Tests**:  
  Focus on small, isolated units of code such as individual functions or classes. They are fast, provide quick feedback, and are usually written and maintained by developers.

- **Component Integration Tests**:  
  In Backend, these validate interactions between connected modules or services — e.g., how an api endpoint work of its own with in the microservice, not covering the processes between other microservices.
  In Client side of apps, these specifically test how **UI components interact within the user interface**. This includes validating things like event handling, data flow through props/state, rendering logic, and boundary behavior between components. These are vital for React, Angular, or other component-based frameworks where functionality often emerges from composition.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:  
  Simulate real user scenarios by interacting with the application from the UI down through backend services or API e2e testing in a test environment. These tests cover full workflows like login, checkout, or user onboarding.

- **Exploratory Testing**:  
  Involves manual, unscripted testing to identify unexpected behaviors, usability concerns, or gaps missed by automation. This usually gathers more information about the application.

## 1. Fresh Startup Applications

For a fresh app of a startup, recently entered the market with a small set of users, here's what works well:

- A solid foundation of **unit tests**  
- Strategic **end-to-end tests** for core flows  
- Emphasis on **exploratory testing** to catch unexpected issues

This is where the **hourglass model** of test distribution fits:

Startups often deal with rapid changes in the features and a limited user base. The priority is speed and flexibility — E2E tests alone won’t be sufficient, but too much testing in the middle layer may need a lot of changes frequently.

If there's time and bandwidth, broader coverage is welcome — but start lean and intentional.

## 2. Scaling Applications

As an application grows, so does:
- The user base  
- The complexity  
- The need for stability

For scaling apps, it's important to add more structure in the **middle layers**, especially **Component Integration** testing.

This is where the **classic testing pyramid** becomes valuable:
- Dense unit tests at the base  
- A moderate number of component integration tests in the middle  
- A smaller number of E2E tests at the top which cover the processes of the application

This model balances speed, granularity, and reliability as the application becomes more feature-rich and change-prone. There are more models of test distribution which can be tried, but that will be covered in another blog. Also, the scaled up application.

## How do you distribute tests across your product lifecycle?

- Do you follow a **testing pyramid**, **hourglass**, or **another model**?
- How do you balance **unit**, **integration**, **E2E**, and **exploratory** tests in your team?

I’d love to hear your approaches and any lessons you've learned in evolving your test distribution strategy. Let’s learn from each other!
