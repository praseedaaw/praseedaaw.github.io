Dreamy Waterfall Painting(60 & 80 cm), a beautiful place must to visit on a twilight night!

# *Dreamy Waterfall* – A Serene Escape on Canvas

There’s something magical about waterfalls. The sound, the motion, the way they capture nature’s power and peace all at once. My latest painting, **“Dreamy Waterfall,”** is my attempt to bring that feeling to life—on an 80x60 cm canvas.

## The Inspiration

This artwork is rooted in a dreamlike vision—a place that feels peaceful, untouched, and surreal. I imagined a cascading waterfall under a glowing full moon, surrounded by cliffs and soft pink trees that add a touch of fantasy. It’s not a real place, but maybe it could be. It’s the kind of scene I’d want to escape to on a quiet evening.

## The Process

I started with the black canvas, then the far away mountains and the highest waterfalls. Then I imagined some rocks and rock edges, the water splashed in all directions creating the misty effect. Slowly the moon started glowing in silver. The lower waterfalls flew over the rocky land down to somewhere far, in between the tunnel created by the cliffs - 2 of those cliffs are so close to us! 

The cliffs on either side are rugged, but not harsh. I kept the edges organic, with earthy tones to contrast the cool blues of the water. And those pink trees? They’re my favorite part. They bring life, softness, and a sense of fantasy to the scene.

## What It Represents

It is upto your eyes and mind. You tell what you perceived while the dreamy waterfall!
